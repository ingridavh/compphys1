How the program works:

1. "main" takes input arguments from the command line:
    - argc
    - argv

2. "spinsystem" takes
    - the number of spins (LxL) n_spins

    It initiates a spin_matrix object, which we can evolve using the Metropolis
    algorithm to find expectation values for the energy and magnetization.

    The class has a function "go" which takes
        - "outfile", the name of the output file

Where should E, M and temp go?
