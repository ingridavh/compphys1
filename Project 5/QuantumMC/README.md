## Project 5, Quantum Monte Carlo of confined electrons

# How to run the code
All the code necessary for running the program is given here. All the public variables can be changed from main.cpp. For instance, for changing the number of MC cycles to 1000000, simply write dots.m\_mcs = 1000000. Other public variables of interest are m\_alpha, m\_beta and m\_omega.  

# Benchmarks
The benchmarks can be found in benchmarks.txt. To run them, you will have to copy the benchmark code into main.cpp, and run it from there. 

# Report
The project report can be found in the report folder.
