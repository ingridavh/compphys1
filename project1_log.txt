About the report:

- remember to include abstract
- clear figures

1b: Algorithm for gaussian elimination for tridiagonal matrices comes from lecture slides:

http://compphysics.github.io/ComputationalPhysics/doc/pub/linalg/html/linalg.html

Note: b tilde (the new b-values) are set to beta in the report AND program.

Note: f goes to f*h**2. f-tilde are the new values in the logarithm, beta are the new bvalues in the program.


Note: Files where results are saved are named 'p1_result_N (n-value).txt'
